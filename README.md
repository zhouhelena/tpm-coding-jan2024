# Team Processing Mapping Coding Task
Welcome to the coding task for the Team Process Mapping project! Before you begin, please make sure to read through the full instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FZ-N-7Qr9_CXK-fX9vdcMhkaDzmRXyUh1aHEHjL1hs/edit).

## Packages and Requirements
The packages required for you to complete the task are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can use a virtual environment for managing the dependencies associated with this project.

## Your Goal
To complete this assignment, you will need to modify 4 different files:
- features/word_count.py: `count_words(text)`
- features/type_token_ratio.py: `get_word_ttr(text)`
- features/politeness_features.py: `get_politeness_strategies(text)`
- utils/calculate_chat_level_features.py (For calling the functions; you only need to modify `apply_politeness()`).

## Your Deliverables
At the end of Part 2, we will need the following:
- A link to your GitHub cloned repository. This should contain:
  1. Your Python code;
  2. Your Part 2 Reflection (directly edit this README!).
- A copy of your chat-level CSV that contains columns for the features you generated. **Note: this should be reproducible!** We should be able to get the same results by running your code from the GitHub link you submit.

# Part 2 Reflection
Please answer the following four questions:

## 1. Sanity Check
Open up your output CSV and look at the columns you generated for each of the three features. Do the values “make sense” intuitively? Why or why not?

## 2. Testing
How would you implement tests for these features?

## 3. Overall Experience
Please provide an overall reflection of your experience. How did you approach this task? What challenge(s) did you encounter? Is there anything you would be curious to explore in the future, if you had more time?

## 4. Time Required
How much time did it take you to complete Parts 1 and 2? (Please be honest; we are looking for feedback to make sure the tasks are scoped appropriately.)
